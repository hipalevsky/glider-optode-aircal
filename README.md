# glider-optode-aircal
 Example and test scripts for processing glider oxygen optode air calibration for OOI
- Hilary Palevsky, palevsky@bc.edu

Glider test data from the OOI Pioneer Endurance arrays was generated to test new glider optode mounts, intended to achieve air calibration while minimizing impacts on glider flight
The function "aircalfun_example" is the current version of in-prep work synthesizing all air-calibrated glider data from the OOI Irminger Array since 2018, when the modified mounts were first deployed through an ancillary NSF-funded project to D. Nicholson and H. Palevsky
